Her father was an executive for Life magazine, and she spent part of her early life living in Japan. She grew up with a love of contemporary pop hits, although her mother\\'s Woody Guthrie and Judy Collins records gave her some interest in country/folk music. She spent her time at home with her guitar, and her father encouraged her to perform at talent nights.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnrolling in Brown University, Carpenter earned a degree in American civilization. Between college years she would play local bars and clubs in the Washington, DC area.  By 1986, she was a local star, winning five Washington Area Music Awards. She released her 1987 debut \"Hometown Girl\", produced by guitarist/producer John Jennings.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe returns to Washington almost every summer to perform at the popular outdoor venue Wolftrap.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassionate Kisses lyrics:\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it too much to ask\\r\\nI want a comfortable bed that won\\'t hurt my back\\r\\nFood to fill me up\\r\\nAnd warm clothes and all that stuff\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have this\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have this\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have all of this, and\\r\\n\\r\\nPassionate kisses\\r\\nPassionate kisses, whoa oh oh\\r\\nPassionate kisses from you\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it too much to demand\\r\\nI want a full house and a rock and roll band\\r\\nPens that won\\'t run out of ink\\r\\nAnd cool quiet and time to think\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have this\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have this\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have all of this, and\\r\\n\\r\\nPassionate kisses\\r\\nPassionate kisses, whoa oh oh\\r\\nPassionate kisses from you\\r\\n\\r\\nDo I want too much\\r\\nAm I going overboard to want that touch\\r\\nI shout it out to the night\\r\\n\"Give me what I deserve, \\'cause it\\'s my right\"\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have this (shouldn\\'t I)\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have this (shouldn\\'t I)\\r\\nShouldn\\'t I have all of this, and\\r\\n\\r\\nPassionate kisses\\r\\nPassionate kisses, whoa oh oh\\r\\nPassionate kisses from you\\r\\nPassionate kisses\\r\\nPassionate kisses, whoa oh oh\\r\\nPassionate kisses from you', '640817', '4.9105591774', '1574', '36', '00:04:01', '241', '[Passionate, Kisses, Mary, Chapin, Carpenter, acoustic, live concert, folk music, guitar, Wolf Trap, Come On Come On, Stones In The Road, live music]', '2011-05-19 08:01:50', '260', '250', '220', '260', '250', '210', '20', '0', '0', '20', '10', '0', '30', '10', '0', '0', '20', '10', '30', '0', '0', '260', '250', '200', '0', '10', '20', '260', '240', '210', 'country']\n",

She delivers her hopeful message that if you pursue your goals, not giving up against limitations and hardship, someday you will have silver lining.\\nEnjoy the music video and look forward to the next STATION track which will be out on April 1st.  \\n\\nAlso here is a message from AMBER :\\n\\nBefore the song is released there are a couple things I\\'d like to share. This song took me a lot of courage to write because I was always apprehensive of the subject it talked about. I\\'ve been doing this job for a long time and right now I speak not as Amber of f(x) nor \"celebrity\" Amber, but just Amber. Just plain, simple, human Amber. \"Borders\" is more than a song; no glamorous concepts, no \"trying to be cool.\" Its a raw and real story about reality. Its shares, not only about my personal experiences but of people very close to me. Everyone involved in this project- the producers, my team DPR, the actors, to the staff- were people specifically chosen as they have never given up on me and believed in my vision. For that, I want to thank them for making this possible for me. When you guys listen to \"Borders\", there is just one thing i wish everyone could take from it: NEVER give up on yourself. There is always hope in the midst of this dark, demanding world. In the end, live for those that did not get the chance to and just keep fighting. Always, thank you you guys. You guys made it possible. \\n\\n\\xeb\\x85\\xb8\\xeb\\x9e\\x98 \\xeb\\x82\\x98\\xec\\x98\\xa4\\xea\\xb8\\xb0\\xec\\xa0\\x84\\xec\\x97\\x90

The person I met in college over ten years ago. The person who was at my very first gig. The person who has seen me at my lowest and the first person I call in muffled sobs when something bad happens. We've been deliriously happy together, deliriously tired and deliriously sad together. I wanted to show our friendship for what it really is- honest, real, electric. I think about the times we drink together until neither of us can stand. The laughing at our own ridiculousness and foolishness. Comparing our trials and errors; overthinking our break ups and new loves, remembering everything we've been through to get to this point and being so proud of it. Two girls from Hereford trying our best in the City. We open our hearts up and take risks, but together we are more powerful than ever. We are challenged every day but we see it through and sometimes it feels like we can conquer anything. \\n \\nWhen I'm with you, I'm standing with an army.\\n \\nBrand new album DELIRIUM out now, including LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO, ON MY MIND and ARMY.\\nBuy now:\\niTunes: http://ell.li/DELIRIUMiTyt\\nAmazon: http://ell.li/DELIRIUMAMZyt\\nOfficial Store: http://ell.li/DELIRIUMD2Cyt\\n \\nStream now:\\nSpotify: http://ell.li/DELIRIUMSpotify\\nApple Music: http://ell.li/GRbRai\\n \\nMore Ellie:\\nhttp://www.elliegoulding.com\\nhttp://www.facebook.com/elliegoulding\\nhttp://www.twitter.com/elliegoulding\\nhttp://www.instagram.com/elliegoulding\\n\\nMusic video by Ellie Goulding performing Army.
